PubG Data analysis
PUBG:  Finish Placement Prediction Problem Statement:  In a PUBG game, up to 100 players start in each match (matchId). Players (Id) can be on teams (groupId) which get ranked at the end of the game (winPlacePerc) based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. During the game, players can pick up different amunitions, revive downed-but-not-dead (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves.
